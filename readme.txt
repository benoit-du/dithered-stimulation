************************************************* 
This package can be used to compute entrainment metrics in the sine cicle map and Kuramoto model, with periodic stimulation or dithered stimulation. The toggling approach is implemented in the Kuramoto model. Although the code should be run on a supercomputer to get entrainment metrics with a good resolution, it can be tested/used on a local machine.

*** folder "SCM": use code in subfolder "SCM_genData" to generate the data, and code in subfolder "SCM_plotArnoldTongues" to plot Arnold tongues.

*** folder "KM": use code in subfolder "KM_genData" to generate the data, and code in subfolder "KM_plotArnoldTongues" to plot Arnold tongues, the mean instantaneous frequency, and the phase locking value.
